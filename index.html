        <h1>why web devlopment?</h1>

        <p>
          I chose Web Development because I want to build real-world digital
          solutions and have the freedom to work from anywhere. As a Computer
          Science student, I find web technologies both practical and exciting.
          It gives me the chance to be creative, earn through freelancing, and
          even build my own online brand like my YouTube channel. I love solving
          problems and seeing instant results, which makes web development
          perfect for me. Most importantly, it's a skill that connects directly
          with my career goals.

          <p>

            way to express my skills, build my career, and create something
            meaningful.The field is always evolving, so there are always new things to learn and explore.

          My inspiration comes from my elder brothers Hasan, Harun, and Ovi Bhai
          and samim. I also get a lot of motivation from Nasir Vai. Besides
